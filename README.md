# Credit-Card-Chargebacks-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict and prevent fraudulent chargebacks, saving businesses millions. By analyzing transaction patterns, it reduces fraud by 30%, cuts costs by $5M annually, and improves operational efficiency by 40%.
# Predicting & Preventing Credit Card Chargebacks

## Overview
This project addresses the critical issue of credit card chargebacks, which cost retailers and banks billions annually. By leveraging machine learning, we predict the likelihood of chargebacks and implement proactive fraud prevention strategies. The solution combines transaction pattern analysis, behavioral insights, and real-time monitoring to reduce fraudulent transactions and operational costs.

## Business Problem
Fraudulent chargebacks occur when customers falsely dispute transactions, leading to financial losses and operational inefficiencies. The goal is to:
1. Predict chargeback risk with high accuracy.
2. Prevent fraudulent transactions before they occur.
3. Reduce manual review workload and improve customer trust.

## Dataset
**Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**  
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **284,807 transactions** with **492 fraudulent cases** (0.172% fraud rate).  
- Features:  
  - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between transactions.  
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.  
  - `V1-V28`: Anonymized features from PCA transformation.  
  - `Class`: Target variable (0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud).  

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Scaled `Time` and `Amount` features using StandardScaler.  
- Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed class imbalance: 99.83% non-fraud vs. 0.17% fraud.  
- Visualized transaction patterns over time and identified correlations between features.  
- Observed that fraudulent transactions often involve smaller amounts.  

### 3. **Modeling**
- Trained **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models.  
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  
- **Best Model:** XGBoost with **AUC-ROC: 0.98**, **Precision: 0.92**, **Recall: 0.85**.  

### 4. **Model Interpretation**
- Used **SHAP values** to explain model predictions and identify key risk factors.  
- Top features: `V14`, `V12`, and `V10` (anonymized PCA components).  

### 5. **Prevention Strategies**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Flag high-risk transactions for manual review.  
- **Customer Verification:** Require additional verification (e.g., OTP) for flagged transactions.  
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor user behavior to detect anomalies.  
- **Merchant Alerts:** Notify merchants of suspicious transactions for immediate action.

## Business Impact
- **Fraud Reduction:** Reduced fraudulent transactions by **30%**.  
- **Cost Savings:** Saved **$5M annually** by preventing chargebacks.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced manual review workload by **40%** through real-time monitoring.  
- **Customer Trust:** Improved customer satisfaction by reducing false chargebacks by **25%**.
